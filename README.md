# Laptop_price_prediction

The project trained two models :Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression.  
After evaluation,Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression and was used as final deployed model

## Deployment

The Streamlit app for this project is live here:  
[Laptop Price prediction app] (https://laptoppriceprediction-wtjq6qfyt8x8wcozgrmcsm.streamlit.app)
